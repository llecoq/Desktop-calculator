# Basic Desktop Calculator

This project is a simple desktop calculator application developed in Rust, utilizing the `fltk-rs` library for the graphical user interface. The goal of this application is to provide basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly desktop environment.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Simple and intuitive GUI

## Prerequisites

To build and run this application, you will need:

- Rust programming language [installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system (comes with Rust installation)

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to develop a basic desktop calculator application using Rust and the `fltk-rs` library, with the intent to fully understand and document the process of compiling a desktop application to WebAssembly (WASM). The functionality of the calculator is not the primary focus; instead, the project aims to explore and highlight the challenges and steps involved in transitioning a Rust-based desktop application to run within a web browser environment through WASM. This exploration will serve as a case study for Rust's cross-platform capabilities and the practicalities of WASM compilation.
